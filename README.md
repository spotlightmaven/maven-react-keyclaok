## Development Task: Implement Keycloak Authentication

### Task Overview
Implement Keycloak authentication within the application. Set up three types of users with varying levels of access to the cards displayed on the homepage and their respective navigation links.

### Task Details
- Set up authentication using Keycloak with the following configurations:
  - `KEYCLOAK_URL`: http://localhost:4000/
  - `KEYCLOAK_REALM`: ReactKeyCloak
  - `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT`: myReactKeyCloak

- Create three users with different roles and permissions:

  1. **Super Admin:**
     - **Permissions:** Full access to all features.
     - **Views:** Can view all cards on the homepage and navigate using all links.

  2. **Admin:**
     - **Permissions:** Limited access.
     - **Views:** Can only see the homepage and the first two cards, along with their respective navigation links. Other cards and links should be hidden.

  3. **User:**
     - **Permissions:** Minimal access.
     - **Views:** Can only see the homepage and the last card, along with its respective navigation link. Other cards and links should be hidden.

### Implementation Steps
1. Set up and configure Keycloak server with the provided details.
2. Implement Keycloak authentication in the React application.
3. Define roles and permissions in Keycloak to correspond with the Super Admin, Admin, and User roles within the application.
4. Implement role-based access control within the React application to restrict access based on user roles.
5. Test to ensure that access restrictions are applied correctly based on the user roles.

### Testing
- Test each user role to ensure they have the correct permissions.
- Ensure that navigation is restricted as outlined in the task details.
- Test the applicationâ€™s behavior when trying to access restricted areas.

### Submission
- Commit and push your changes to a new branch.
- Open a pull request with a description detailing the changes made, and mention any challenges or issues encountered during implementation.
- Request code review from a team lead or senior developer.

### Notes
- Ensure to handle authentication errors gracefully, providing adequate feedback to the user.
- Secure sensitive information and ensure it's not exposed or leaked in any way.
